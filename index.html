        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. 
            These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. 
            Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.
             As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. 
             Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>
